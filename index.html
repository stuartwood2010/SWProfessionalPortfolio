        <p>
          My name is Stuart Wood and I am a Colorado Native. I am currently a self employed truck driver,
          although I have worked in many different industries. I am studying to become a full stack web developer
          and should complete my bootcamp in the spring of 2022. My other hobbies include golf, gaming, and traveling. 
          My wife and I are on a mission to visit all 50 states, along with many other countries around the world. 
          I have experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, node, express, MySql, Handlebars, and many more to come.
          It would be an honor to work with you on something. I look forward to hearing from you!
